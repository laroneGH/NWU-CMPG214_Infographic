# NWU CMPG214 Infographic
Hi, my name is Laroné le Roux. I am a second year at the Nort-West Universtity.
This assignment is all about identity, not on a superficial level, but truly who we are at the very core.
## The Idea Behind the Logo and Infographic
I battled skin cancer and bear the scars. I was inspired by the Japanese art 'Kintsugi', where a broken pot is repaired with a mixture containing gold, and its (now) 'imperfections' are celebrated and even admired.
The scar on my face is my 'personal Kintsugi' that not only makes me unique physically, but has also taught me valuable lessons.
